Learning the Git. 
This is the first file which I am adding in the Project Folder. 

Now we make the first time modifications in the file "TextFile1" . We have to again add it to repository. 

Now we will edit the multiple files, and commit them to repository. 

Now I will modify the file again , and will not commit it . Then I will see the diffrences between the file in Repository and the file in the Working Copy. 
For this use the command " git diff"
